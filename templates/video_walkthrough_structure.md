## Structure for a Short Coding Tutorial Video

Intro (30 seconds)
1. Title Screen (5 seconds):
   * Display the title of the video (e.g., "Introduction to Variables and Loops in Python").
   * Include appropriate branding or logo (video editor can help with this)

2. Introduction (25 seconds):
   * Briefly introduce yourself and the purpose of the video.
   * State what the viewer will learn, e.g. "In this video, we’ll review the coding practice problems where you worked on the basics of variables in JavaScript."

Body (1 - 4 minutes)
3. Topic: Variables (1*2 minutes):
   * Explanation (30 seconds):
     * Define what variables are and their importance in programming.
   * Demonstration (30*60 seconds):
     * Show how to declare and initialize variables in JavaScript.
     * Give an Example: `x = 5`, `name = "Alice"`
   * Review Practice Exercise from Coding Practice section (30 seconds):
     * Repeat to show each practice exercise 

Outro (30 seconds)

4. Summary (15 seconds):
   * Recap what was covered: "Today, we learned about variables in JavaScript."
   * Emphasize the key points to remember.

5. Call to Action (15 seconds):
   * Encourage viewers to practice what they've learned.
   * Provide any additional resources or recommendations for further learning.

Script Example

Intro
"Hi, I'm Randall, and welcome to this video walkthrough. In today's video, we'll cover the basics of variables in JS. By the end of this video, you'll understand how to use these fundamental concepts in your own coding projects." We’ll review the coding practices you’ve completed as part of this learning module.

Body
"Let's start with variables. Variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout your program. For example, we can create a variable `x` and assign it the value 5 by writing `x = 5`. Similarly, we can create a string variable `name` and assign it 'Alice' with `name = "Alice"`."

Screen shows code being typed out and executed.

Outro
"To recap, today we covered how to declare and use variables in JS. Remember to practice these concepts to get comfortable with them. Happy coding!"

### Visual and Audio Elements
* Visuals:
  * Screen captures of the code editor (stackblitz) with clear, readable text.
  * Highlighting key parts of the code as you explain them (video editor can help with this during edit review).
  * Occasional on-screen text to reinforce important points.
* Audio:
  * Clear and concise narration.
  * Background music that is subtle and not distracting (video editor will help with this).
