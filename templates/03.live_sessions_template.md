## Live Sessions A: 
### Session A (Review and Q&A):
_Example_: Describe which topics from the weekâ€™s self-study will be covered in Session A.
Explain to the learners, they'll work on interactive coding exercises related to the objectives covered so far.

 _Description Example_: During this week's session A, we will develop a Python script to calculate Fibonacci numbers efficiently, implementing a recursive function for computation and a main workflow to handle user input and output display.

 _Prerequisites_: self-study topics/statement

## Live Sessions B:

### Session B (Project Work and Application):
_Example:_ Collaborate on the course project (explain what is required of learners to complete the sprint project, applying concepts learned.
Receive feedback and guidance on project development.

_Description Example_: During this week's Live Session B, we will create a Python function that iterates through a given string, counting occurrences of specified characters. We will also prep for the sprint project while reviewing how to implement a robust workflow to handle input validation, process execution, and result presentation for enhanced usability and clarity.

 _Prerequisites_: self-study topics/statement
